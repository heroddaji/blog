Good/best approach to use Atom Editor / IDE to practice React Native
==
[React Native](http://www.reactnative.com/) is awesome, it allows you to code in javascript, then deliver native app deployment for both Android and iOS.

As I have never learn javascript before, I am trying to practice it bit by bit by going through good tutorials online, etc.. But I really hate to code a little bit, then look at the tutorial webpage, then go back and code. Although I have two monitors, it is not really helping in dthe working flow. Moreover, I don't like to keep switching my neck, haha.

And to start with coding in javascript, I also try the new and awesome [Atom text editor](https://atom.io/packages), you should definitively use it, it is just so awesome.

And the trick I apply to have more focus, and less head switching is to have 2 open-panes in Atom, one for writing code, one for **viewing the tutorial directly in side Atom**, using the also very awesome [Browser-plus plugin](https://atom.io/packages/browser-plus)

that's it, happy coding and practice ReactNative gals and guys
